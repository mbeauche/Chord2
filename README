A reservation system for music practice rooms at UMass Amherst. Allows
users to select re-occuring practice reservations as well as cancel or
swap individual instances. The main page will display the user's 
personal schedule of reserved rooms.  

We plan to use node.js, express, socket.io, mongodb and jquery.

To run this application you need MongoDB, and Mongoose.
